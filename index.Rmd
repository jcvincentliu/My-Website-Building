## Bio

Vincent is a first-year MS-Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MS-CAPP) student at the University of Chicago with demonstrated interests in criminal justice policy, k12 education, survey analysis, data visualizations, and machine learning. Since undergrad, he has been believing the power of minority and activated for social and criminal justice. He dreams for the day where social science reins the research and practice of public policies. He is also a dedicated and incurable heavy metal and hard rock lover. His favorite band of all time is Metallica because the band's songs always give him power and energies. He loves saying "Life without energy can not be called life.".
